I am Lorenzo Posti, currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Astronomical Observatory
of Strasbourg (France). Before that, I've been doing research in Astrophysics in
Groningen (Netherlands), Bologna (Italy), Oxford (UK) and Baltimore (USA).

You can find my updated *list of publications* on [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/fCiUp3W_T7qXYNboezCKAg).
I used to maintain a personal website with some details on my research, however I stopped
doing that for various reasons. An archived and stripped-down version can be found
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210624122158/http://astro.u-strasbg.fr/~posti/).

You can reach out to me at [lorenzo.posti@gmail.com](mailto:lorenzo.posti@gmail.com).
